# Javiar-Assistant

Ver 0.5.2

I have been working for the past few days on a voice assistant, named Javiar. 
It is not done yet and it has a few bugs i'll resolve in the future (ex: Sometimes, when searching wikipedia for an article, it'll crash).

It can open websites, search wikipedia articles, read the latest news (from bbc) and tell the time. I tried to include as many human-like conversations.

In the future, i want to add object recognition, news categories, improve voice accuracy and many more.
