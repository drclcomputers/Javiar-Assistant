# Javiar-Assistant

Ver 0.5.2

I have been working for the past few days on a voice assistant, named Javiar. 
It is not done yet and it has a few bugs i'll resolve in the future (ex: Sometimes, when searching wikipedia for an article, it'll crash).

It can open websites, search wikipedia articles, read the latest news (from bbc) and tell the time. I tried to include as many human-like conversations.

In the future, i want to add object recognition, news categories, improve voice accuracy and many more.

Speak clearly after the tone.

Commands:
-Wikipedia
-browse the internet
-search for the news
-tell a joke
-tell the time
-tell the date

Note: You don't have to tell these exact commands. Just include the action you want Javiar to perform.

Note: To close it, tell "shut down" or "sleep".
