# Javiar-Assistant

Ver 0.3.6

I have been working for the past few days on a voice assistant, named Javiar. 
It is not done yet and it has a few bugs i'll resolve in the future (ex: Sometimes, when searching wikipedia for an article, it'll crash).

It can open websites, search wikipedia articles, read the latest news (from bbc) and tell the time. It is very limited in terms of conversations.

In the future, i want to add object recognition, news categories, nicer conversations, improve voice accuracy and many more.
